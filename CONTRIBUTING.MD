# Contributing

Thank you so much for viewing this file! You would like contribute, right? Right now, we're looking for people
that know some modern Python and a little bit of Linux. Once we get that part bolted in, some documentation would be great!

If you are one of those people that are tech savvy, please follow the instructions below!

## Installation requirements
All you need is `Python 3.6` and `pip` (and a machine that runs Python, of course). Once you have those installed, go write some code!

## Style guidelines
- All functions and methods are in snake case (i.e. `snake_case`)
- All classes are in pascal case (i.e. `PascalCase`)
- All classes inherit from `object` unless specified
- All custom exceptions inherit from the base exception
- All try/except blocks must include the base exception
- More guidelines probably will be included
