# Contributing

Thank you so much for viewing this file! You would like contribute, right? Right now, we're looking for people
that know some modern Python and a little bit of Linux. Once we get that part bolted in, some documentation would be great!

If you are one of those people that are tech savvy, please follow the instructions below!

## Installation requirements
If you want to help with the core software, `pibakesoftware`, please install the following:
* `Python 3.6`
* `pip for Python 3`

If you want to help with the utilities (the only utility that exists right now is `uuid`), please go [Rust's](https://rust-lang.org) website and install Rust. All the tools needed for building, running, and testing Rust is included.

## Style guidelines
- All functions and methods are in snake case (i.e. `snake_case`)
- All classes are in pascal case (i.e. `PascalCase`)
- All classes inherit from `object` unless specified
- All custom exceptions inherit from the base exception
- All try/except blocks must include the base exception
- More guidelines probably will be included
- `import` and `from import` statements must be seperated
- Argument attributes and initialization attributes must be seperated
- `if/else/elif` statements should whitespace between them when in a block
